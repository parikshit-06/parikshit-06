I build real-world robotics & AI projects, mainly UAVs, that actually work outside the lab. I’m not about shiny theory. I push through engineering headaches to ship usable tech combining vision, audio, control, and real-time systems.

## What I’m Building

* **AirSight:** Real-time drone detection using CNNs on images + MFCC audio. Lightweight enough to run on Jetson Nano & Raspberry Pi.  

* **GestureNav:** Controlling drones with hand gestures using MediaPipe + ROS2 + PX4. From gestures to flight commands, no middleman.  

* **Domain Adaptive Skeleton Model:** Modular GPT-2 fine-tuning with LoRA adapters for custom domains (legal, sports).  

* **3D Path Planning & Obstacle Avoidance:** MATLAB Simulink + LiDAR data with classic planners (A*, RRT*) plus RL experiments.

## Personal Philosophy

> “Don’t bend; don’t water it down; don’t try to make it logical; don’t edit your own soul according to the fashion. Rather, follow your most intense obsessions mercilessly.”  


> “The mystery of human existence lies not in just staying alive, but in finding something to live for.”
