# Hey, I‚Äôm Parikshit Sonwane

### Student | Robotics & UAV Dev | ML & Embedded Systems | Open Source

I build real-world robotics & AI projects, mainly UAVs, that actually work outside the lab. I‚Äôm not about shiny theory‚ÄîI push through engineering headaches to ship usable tech combining vision, audio, control, and real-time systems.

## What I‚Äôm Building

* **AirSight:** Real-time drone detection using CNNs on images + MFCC audio. Lightweight enough to run on Jetson Nano & Raspberry Pi.
* **GestureNav:** Controlling drones with hand gestures using MediaPipe + ROS2 + PX4. From gestures to flight commands, no middleman.
* **Domain Adaptive Skeleton Model:** Modular GPT-2 fine-tuning with LoRA adapters for custom domains (legal, sports).
* **3D Path Planning & Obstacle Avoidance:** MATLAB Simulink + LiDAR data with classic planners (A\*, RRT\*) plus RL experiments.
